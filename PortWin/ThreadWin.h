/// @brief ThreadWin is class to ease the creation of worker threads. The underlying 
///	threads are created with the Win32 CreateThread() API.
///
/// @details Inherit from ThreadWin and override Process() in the derived class.
/// Process() is the thread entry function. 
///
/// In addition to encapsulating thread creation and destruction, ThreadWin has 
/// these main features.
///
/// 1) Synchronized start - all the threads can be created, then block waiting for
/// StartAllThreads() to release all simultaneously. 
///
/// 2) Forced queue creation - the thread message queue is created before the thread
/// is run. If a thread is created and a message posted too early before the queue 
/// is created, the message is lost. This feature solves that problem. 
///
/// 3) Inherit from CallbackThread and implement DispatchCallback() to post callback 
/// messages into the thread queue. 
///
/// 4) Thread exit - an orderly exit and cleanup of the thread.
